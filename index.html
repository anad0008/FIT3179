                <span class="italics">The International Tourism to Population Ratio </span> 
                Tourism is officially recognized as a directly measurable activity, <br>
                enabling more accurate analysis and more effective policy. <br>
                Tourism today possesses a range of instruments to track its productive activities <br>
                and the activities of the consumers that drive them: visitors (both tourists and excursionists). <br>
                An increasing number of countries have opened up and invested in tourism development, <br>
                making tourism a key driver of socio-economic progress through export revenues, <br>
                the creation of jobs and enterprises, and infrastructure development. <br>
                As an internationally traded service, <br>
                inbound tourism has become one of the world's major trade categories. <br>
                For many developing countries it is one of the main sources of foreign exchange income 
                and a major component of exports, <br>
                creating much needed employment and development opportunities. [2] <br>
                This data has been normalised to compare tourism arrival numbers to a countries population. <br>
